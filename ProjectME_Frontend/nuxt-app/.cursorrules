  Prevents Cursor from writing manual import statements for components that live in the /components directory.

  Assumes that components in that directory are auto-registered by the framework (e.g. Nuxt 3).

---

⛔ **Do not write `import MyComponent from '~/components/MyComponent.vue'` or similar.**

✅ **Use `<MyComponent />` directly in the template. Nuxt/Vue will handle the import automatically.**

This applies to:

- All imports from `~/components/`, `@/components/`, or relative paths like `../components/`

- Vue component files with `.vue` or `.ts/.js` component definitions

- Both `<script setup>` and classic script blocks

Cursor should assume that all components from `/components` are auto-available and never suggest importing them manually.

  Enforces that empty HTML elements like <div></div> are written using self-closing syntax <div />.

  This improves readability and keeps templates clean.

---

⛔ **Avoid writing empty HTML tags like `<div></div>` or `<span></span>`.**

✅ **Instead, write them as self-closing: `<div />`, `<span />`, etc.**

⛔ **Never use `<style> … </style>` tags or external CSS files.**

  Ensures that all frontend changes are optimized for tablet devices.

  This frontend is designed for tablet usage. A separate mobile app is being developed for phones.

  The minimum supported resolution is tablet size. The app is also used on desktops and laptops, so it should scale up responsively.

---

✅ **Always design and adjust layouts, interactions, and styling with tablet devices as the minimum target.**  

⛔ **Do not optimize for phones (≤ 640px) - a separate app handles that.**  

⛔ **Do not assume a desktop-only layout.**

✅ **Minimum resolution: tablet (768px+). The app should scale responsively up to desktop/laptop sizes.**

✅ **Optimize for tablet screen sizes (typically 768px - 1024px width, portrait and landscape) as the baseline, but ensure it works well on larger screens too.**

When modifying or generating UI code, Cursor should:

- Design for tablet viewport sizes (768px - 1024px width range) as the minimum

- Ensure responsive scaling to larger screens (desktops, laptops)

- Support both portrait and landscape orientations on tablets

- Use touch-friendly interactions (larger tap targets than desktop, but can be more compact than phone)

- Use responsive Tailwind classes with tablet breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) as primary targets

- Ensure layouts work well in both orientations on tablets and scale appropriately on larger screens

- Consider tablet-specific UX patterns (split views, sidebars, etc.) that also work on desktop

- Keep fonts readable but can be smaller than phone-optimized designs

- Ensure buttons and interactive elements are touch-friendly but don't need to be as large as phone interfaces

- Use max-width containers or appropriate constraints to prevent layouts from becoming too wide on large desktop screens
